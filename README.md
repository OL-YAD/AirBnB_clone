# <h1 align="center">AirBnB clone - The Console Project </h1>


## DESCRIPTION

**AirBnB** is a *complete web application*, integrating database storage, a back-end API, and front-end interface.
The goal of the project is to deploy on your server a simple copy of the **AirBnB website**.

##  The Console 

This is the first piece of the project 
 
 #### The console 
    - create your data model
    - manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interpreter
    - store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)


### How to Start the command line interpreter

The Commandline Interpreter can be started by executing the command `./console.py`. 
The `console` can `create`, `destroy`, and `update` objects. 
Type `help` within the console to get a list of command options and its function.


this shell works like this in interactive mode:
```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb) 
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) quit
$
```
